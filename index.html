                <!-- The CPU is the working horse of every day tasks in a computer. It manages every click and every piece of logic the computer needs to handle. 
                When things need calculations or images need to be sent to the GPU for display, everything is done by the CPU. 
            If It was a football match it would be the coach and referee.   -->

                Every frame if rendered simultaniously with complex code to provide the best image quality. If the CPu can feed it fast enough from Ram. this is what makes it look good.  -->
